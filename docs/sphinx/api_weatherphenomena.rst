.. cpp:namespace-push:: WeatherPhenomena

Type definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	.. cpp:enum-class:: Qualifier

		Intensity, proximity or time of observation. 

		.. cpp:enumerator:: NONE

			No qualifier. This group reports current weather observed at location.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: RECENT

			This group reports recent weather rather than current weather.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: VICINITY

			This group reports weather in vicinity rather than on site.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: LIGHT

			Light intensity.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: MODERATE

			Moderate intensity. This qualier is used with precipitation only.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: HEAVY

			Heavy intensity.


	.. cpp:enum-class:: Descriptor

		Additional properties of weather phenomena.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: NONE

			No additional descriptor for weather phenomena specified.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: SHALLOW

			This descriptor is only be used to further describe fog that has little vertical extent (less than 6 feet), i.e. ground fog.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: PARTIAL

			This descriptors is only be used to further describe fog that has little vertical extent (normally greater than or equal to 6 feet but less than 20 feet), and reduces horizontal visibility, but to a lesser extent vertically. The stars may often be seen by night and the sun by day. The fog is covering only the part of the aerodrome.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: PATCHES

			This descriptors is only be used to further describe fog that has little vertical extent (normally greater than or equal to 6 feet but less than 20 feet), and reduces horizontal visibility, but to a lesser extent vertically. The stars may often be seen by night and the sun by day. The fog consists of patches randomly covering the aerodrome.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: LOW_DRIFTING

			When dust, sand, or snow is raised by the wind to less than 6 feet, "low drifting" shall be used to further describe the weather phenomenon.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: BLOWING

			When dust, sand, snow, or spray is raised by the wind to a height of 6 feet or more, "blowing" shall be used to further describe the weather phenomenon.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: SHOWERS

			Precipitation characterized by the suddenness with which they start and stop, by the rapid changes of intensity, and usually by rapid changes in the appearance of the sky.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: THUNDERSTORM

			A local storm produced by a cumulonimbus cloud that is accompanied by lightning and/or thunder. Thunderstorm may be reported without any accompanying precipitation.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: FREEZING

			When fog is occurring and the temperature is below 0Â°C, this descriptor is used to further describe the phenomena.

			..note:: The fog is described as 'freezing' at freezing temperatures, regardless of whether is deposits the rime.

			When drizzle and/or rain freezes upon impact and forms a glaze on the ground or other exposed objects, this descriptor is used to further describe the precipitation.


	.. cpp:enum-class:: Weather

		Describes precipitation, obscuration and other weather phenomena.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: NOT_REPORTED

			An automatic observing system is used and the present weather cannot be
			observed.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: DRIZZLE

			Fairly uniform precipitation composed exclusively of fine drops with diameters of less than 0.02 inch (0.5 mm) very close together. Drizzle appears to float while following air currents, although unlike fog droplets, it falls to the ground.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: RAIN

			Precipitation, either in the form of drops larger than 0.02 inch (0.5 mm), or smaller drops which, in contrast to drizzle, are widely separated.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: SNOW

			Precipitation of snow crystals, mostly branched in the form of six-pointed stars.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: SNOW_GRAINS

			Precipitation of very small, white, and opaque grains of ice.

			Precipitation of transparent or translucent pellets of ice, which are round or irregular, rarely conical, and which have a diameter of 0.2 inch (5 mm), or less. There are two main types:

				#. Hard grains of ice consisting of frozen raindrops, or largely melted and refrozen snowflakes.
				
				#. Pellets of snow encased in a thin layer of ice which have formed from the freezing, either of droplets intercepted by the pellets, or of water resulting from the partial melting of the pellets.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: HAIL

			Precipitation in the form of small balls or other pieces of ice falling separately or frozen together in irregular lumps.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: SMALL_HAIL

			Precipitation of white, opaque grains of ice. The grains are round or sometimes conical. Diameters range from about 0.08 to 0.2 inch (2 to 5 mm).

			Small hail is also called 'snow pellets' or 'graupel'.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: UNDETERMINED

			Precipitation type that is reported if the automated station detects the occurrence of precipitation but the precipitation discriminator cannot recognize the type.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: MIST

			A visible aggregate of minute water particles suspended in the atmosphere that reduces visibility to less than 7 statute miles but greater than or equal to 5/8 statute miles. Essentially the same as fog but less dense.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: FOG

			A visible aggregate of minute water particles (droplets) which are based at the Earth's surface and reduces horizontal visibility to less than 5/8 statute mile and, unlike drizzle, it does not fall to the ground.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: SMOKE

			A suspension in the air of small particles produced by combustion. A transition to haze may occur when smoke particles have traveled great distances (25 to 100 miles or more) and when the larger particles have settled out and the remaining particles have become widely scattered through the atmosphere.

			Fine particles of rock powder that originate from a volcano and that may remain suspended in the atmosphere for long periods.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: DUST

			Widespread dust. Fine particles of earth or other matter raised or suspended in the air by the wind that may have occurred at or far away from the station which may restrict horizontal visibility.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: SAND

			Sand particles raised by the wind to a height sufficient to reduce horizontal visibility.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: HAZE

			A suspension in the air of extremely small, dry particles invisible to the naked eye and sufficiently numerous to give the air an opalescent appearance.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: SPRAY

			An ensemble of water droplets torn by the wind from the surface of an extensive body of water, generally from the crests of waves, and carried up a short distance into the air.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: DUST_WHIRLS

			Well-developed Dust/Sand Whirl. An ensemble of particles of dust or sand, sometimes accompanied by small litter, raised from the ground in the form of a whirling column of varying height with a small diameter and an approximately vertical axis.

		.. cpp:enumerator:: SQUALLS

			A strong wind characterized by a sudden onset in which the wind speed increases at least 16 knots and is sustained at 22 knots or more for at least one minute (see paragraph 12.6.8.e.(1)).

		.. cpp:enumerator:: DUSTSTORM

			Duststorm. A severe weather condition characterized by strong winds and dust-filled air over an extensive area.


	.. cpp:enum-class:: Event

Validating
^^^^^^^^^^

		.. cpp:function:: bool isValid() const

			:returns: ``true`` if the weather phenomena is valid, and ``false`` otherwise.

				The information is considered valid if all of the following conditions is met: 
					 - weather phenomena is non-empty, i.e. at lease one qualifier or descriptor or weather must be specified;
					 - event time is valid if specified;
					 - if descriptor FZ (freezing) is present, the weather phenomena must contain FG (fog), or the precipitation type which is potentially may freeze: UP (undetermined precipitation), or RA(rain), or DZ (drizzle); other precipitation may be present alone with specified above, e.g. ``FZRASN`` (freezing rain and snow) is valid, while ``FZSNPL`` (freezing snow and ice pellets) is not valid;

Formats
-------

See also WeatherGroup :ref:`api_weathergroup:Formats` section for details.

Metaf recognises current and recent weather phenomena information in METAR reports and forecast weather phenomena in METAR trends and in TAF reports.

..note:: Forecast weather phenomena have exactly the same format as current weather phenomena.

Current or forecast weather phenomena are represented by class :cpp:class:`WeatherPhenomena` and consist of:
- one qualifier (:cpp:enum:`WeatherPhenomena::Qualifier`) or no qualifier.
- one descriptor (:cpp:enum:`WeatherPhenomena::Descriptor`) or no desciptor
- obscuration or precipitation or other phenomena, or mixed precipitation (this part may be missing in some cases discussed below).

Recent weather included in METAR report body consists of:
- mandatory qualifier 'Recent'
- one descriptor or no descriptor
- precipitation or mixed precipitation (this part may be missing in group ``RETS`` descussed below).

Qualifiers augment weather information with intensity, proximity or time. The weather qualifiers used by Metaf, their corresponding types and meanings are below.
