METAR & TAF parsing guide
=========================

.. cpp:namespace-push:: metaf

This section concentrates on METAR and TAF groups and how exactly they are parsed by Metaf.

It is not intended as a guide on METAR or TAF reports, groups, and formats. Rather than that it gives realistic examples which what is parsed by Metaf (and what isn't), and which data output is produced.
