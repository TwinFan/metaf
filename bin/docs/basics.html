<h2>Groups<a class="headerlink" href="#groups" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>METAR or TAF report consists of a number of tokens called Groups.</p>
<p>For example in the following report:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">METAR</span> <span class="n">LSGG</span> <span class="mi">092050</span><span class="n">Z</span> <span class="n">VRB01KT</span> <span class="n">CAVOK</span> <span class="mi">19</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">14</span> <span class="n">Q1022</span> <span class="n">NOSIG</span><span class="o">=</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>the first group is METAR, the second group is LSGG, the third group is 092050Z, and so on. The last group in this report is NOSIG.</p>
<p>Character ‘=’ means end of METAR or TAF report. Metaf parser does not require this character at the end of the report, it just ignores everything after ‘=’ character. Character ‘=’ is not a part of the last group.</p>
<p>There are many types of groups and each type represents a particular bit of information. In example above, METAR means that report contains a scheduled weather observation, LSGG is an ICAO-location where observation was performed (LSGG = Geneva/Cointrin Airport), and NOSIG means that no significant changes of weather conditions are expected.</p>
<p>Groups are typically separates by a single space. Metaf however supports groups separated by one or more space, tabulation, new line and carriage return characters.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="metar-report-format">
<h2>METAR report format<a class="headerlink" href="#metar-report-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The syntax of the METAR report interpreted by Metaf parser is as follows:</p>
<img alt="_images/metar.svg" src="_images/metar.svg" /><p>If any part of the report does not follow this format, parser stops and generates an error.</p>
<p>METAR or SPECI is a report type. METAR indicates ‘normal’ scheduled report and SPECI is used for unscheduled report which is issued dut to sudden changes in weather conditions: wind shift, visibility decrease, severe weather, clouds formed or dissipated, etc. If report type is ommitted from the report, Metaf will try to autodetect it by following the report syntax.</p>
<p>COR means that report is a correctional one.</p>
<p>AUTO means that report was produced by automated station with no human intervention or oversight.</p>
<p>NIL means missing report.</p>
<p>Location is an ICAO location code (4 characters including letters or digits, first character must be a letter).</p>
<p>Time contains day-of-month and time when the report was released or issued.</p>
<p>Maintenance indicator ‘$’ may be included at the end of the report to indicated that automated station requires maintenance.</p>
<div class="section" id="metar-report-body">
<h3>METAR Report body<a class="headerlink" href="#metar-report-body" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is the main part of the METAR report. Its syntax is as follows:</p>
<img alt="_images/metar_body.svg" src="_images/metar_body.svg" /><div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Since in practice reports do not always adhere to this format precisely, parser would not stop or generate error if the actual METAR report body syntax diverges from the scheme above.</p>
</div>
<p>Wind is a surface wind information, including direction, speed and gust speed. Sector of variable wind direction may be optionally included.</p>
<p>Visibility contains a prevailing visibility value along with directional visibility if significant directional variation is observed. Clouds is an information related to cloud layer(s), lack of clouds or unability to detect cloud cover. Alternatively CAVOK may be specified which stands for ‘Ceiling And Visibility OK’.</p>
<p>Current weather is essentially a list of weather phenomena complete with intensity/proximity qualifier or description.</p>
<p>Temperature and dew point are actual measurements of ambient air temperature and dew point.</p>
<p>Atmospheric pressure is an actual atmospheric pressure value measured at aerodrome.</p>
<p>Recent weather may be included if significant weather phenomena ended recently. The format is similar to current weather.</p>
<p>Runway visual range may be reported for one or more runways in poor visibility conditions.</p>
<p>Runway state is an information on accumulation of deposits (water, snow, slush, ice, etc.) on the runway. Alternatively R/SNOCLO or SNOCLO may be included to indicate that the aerodrome is closed due to snow accumulation.</p>
<p>Wind shear is an information of wind shear along with the height where it occurs. The format is similar to surface wind.</p>
<p>Rainfall for recent period of time is reported by weather stations in Australia.</p>
<p>State of sea surface is reported by some oil platforms and contains information on sea surface temperature and wave height.</p>
<p>Colour codes may be included in the report for aerodromes operated by military of NATO members and are used to quickly assess visibility and ceiling conditions.</p>

<div class="section" id="taf-report-format">
<h2>TAF report format<a class="headerlink" href="#taf-report-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The syntax of the TAF report interpreted by Metaf parser is as follows:</p>
<img alt="_images/taf.svg" src="_images/taf.svg" /><p>If any part of the report does not follow this format, parser stops and generates an error.</p>
<p>TAF report typically begins with TAF to indicated the report type. If report type is ommitted from the report, Metaf will try to autodetect it by following the report syntax.</p>
<p>COR means correctional report and AMD means amended report.</p>
<p>NIL means missing report and CNL means cancelled report.</p>
<p>Location is an ICAO location code and time is the time when the report was released or issued. The format is simlar to METAR reports.</p>
<p>Time span indicates the time when TAF report is applicable.</p>
<div class="section" id="taf-report-body">
<h3>TAF Report body<a class="headerlink" href="#taf-report-body" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Main part of TAF report lists prevailing weather conditions expected during the time period when report is applicable.</p>
<img alt="_images/taf_body.svg" src="_images/taf_body.svg" /><div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Since in practice reports do not always adhere to this format precisely, parser would not stop or generate error if the actual TAF report body syntax diverges from the scheme above.</p>
</div>
<p>Wind, Visibility, Cloud and Weather information are the same as used in METAR report.</p>
<p>Temperature forecast indicates maximum and minimum temperature expected during the time period when report is applicable.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trends">
<h2>Trends<a class="headerlink" href="#trends" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Trends can be optionally included with both METAR and TAF to indicate the expected weather condition changes.</p>
<p>Trend begins with one or more trend groups which describe what kind of change is expected, when it is expected, what is the probability, etc. Trend groups are followed by usual groups describing which weather conditions are expected (e.g. wind, visibility, weather phenomena, etc).</p>
<p>METAR trends differ slightly from TAF trends.</p>
<p>The syntax of the trends included in METAR reports is as follows:</p>
<img alt="_images/metar_trend.svg" src="_images/metar_trend.svg" /><p>The syntax of the trends includes in TAF reports are as follows:</p>
<img alt="_images/taf_trend.svg" src="_images/taf_trend.svg" /><div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Since in practice reports do not always adhere to this format precisely, parser would not stop or generate error if the actual METAR or TAF trend syntax diverges from the scheme above.</p>
</div>
<p>NOSIG is used in METAR report only, when no significant weather changes are expected.</p>
<p>TAF trends use probability groups PROB30 and PROB40 to indicate the probability (in percent) of the following trend. If the probability is 50 percent of higher then probability is not specified. If the probability is 20 percent or lower then trend is not included in TAF report.</p>
<p>BECMG, TEMPO, INTER and FMxxxxxx are trend types. BECMG indicates that weather conditions are about to change gradually. TEMPO indicates that weather phenomena may temporarily arise for the duration of less than 60 minutes. INTER (only used in Australia) is similar to TEMPO but indicates that duration of temporary weather phenomena is less than 30 minutes. FMxxxxxx means that all previous weather conditions are superseded by the following conditions since time xxxxxx.</p>
<p>METAR and TAF use different notation to indicate time interval during which the trend is applicable.</p>
<p>In TAF time span is used. It is formatted as xxxx/yyyy where xxxx is time of begin and yyyy is time of end.</p>
<p>In METAR groups FMxxxx / TLxxxx / ATxxxx are used to indicate time ‘from’, ‘till’ and ‘at’ respectively.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Old TAFs use slightly different format for time spans and trends. Metaf currently does not parse this old format.</p>
</div>
<p>The main part of the trend is similar to METAR/TAF report body and contains information on weather phenomena expected at certain time,</p>
<p>A special group NWS (Nil Significant Weather) may be used to indicate the end of previous weather phenomena.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="remarks">
<h2>Remarks<a class="headerlink" href="#remarks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Remarks are currently parsed as plain text only.</p>
